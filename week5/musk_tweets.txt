@austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
@PPathole @toadmeister Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.
@flyerandyp @mojosusan Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6, however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely.
@flcnhvy That free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts ~4 million tons of mass into energy every second. We just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization.
@jwangARK Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
@electricfuture5 We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.
@Erdayastronaut @PelleBrannvall @flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX There are sensitive elements, but they’re on the inside.

@EVHQ2 @TashaARK Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won’t need to wait for FSD.
@teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
@WholeMarsBlog I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
@cleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe.
@flcnhvy The remake has the potential to be great. I kinda liked the original tbh, but it’s possible to take it up a level.
@William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity — needs several more Starlink launches. I’m using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet.
@samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.
@Alert_Alarms Just go through resonant modes fast. It’s when you hang out there that problems arise.
@engineers_feed Technically, James Watt measured a pony, added 50% &amp; rounded up haha https://t.co/vnkO0MTrUC
@jwangARK @wintonARK Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don’t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.
@SpaceIntellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages My favorite is one in tension, other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut.
@Erdayastronaut Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We’ll do lots of flights.
@PPathole The “early investor” part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I’ve ever worked with and that’s saying something!) for years.

@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.
@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed

"@Ali_Tesla585 @NYKChannel This might be part of the problem: “GM is warning owners not to charge their Bolts in or near their homes overnight”

@NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isn’t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V.
"@visegrad24 Space is hard. Took @SpaceX 4 tries to reach orbit. 

They can probably do it in fewer. 

But then it gets vastly harder to achieve truly useful reusability. Only SpaceX has ever done that."
"This shows why a regulatory overhaul is necessary. 

The burden of mountains of regulations is why the high speed rail can’t get down in California and the bridge that the ship hit still hasn’t been fixed."

As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.

@timkhiggins Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.

@Travis_4_Trump Yeah, they lost their minds when a single bus load of illegals was sent there, but have no empathy at all for small towns in the Midwest that are deluged with tens of thousands of illegals

Congratulations to WARR team from Tech Univ Munich for winning 2nd @Hyperloop competition! Peak speed of 324 km/h, which is over 200 mph!!

@BenjaminCoop3 Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
@EcoHeliGuy Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.

Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)
@mcannonbrookes $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
@W4AS Good grief, I'm not "working" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction.
Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
@danahull I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
@gdoehne @reddit Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
@dtweiseth If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically
@VinnyLingham Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.
Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.
Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works, software will start uploading tmrw.
@pcwizardllc Will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle, ie you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign
Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week

@thefrownyface @massossltd I read a story about a father whose son died incredibly quickly. Can be as little as half an hour in hot sun.
V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments.
@scrappydog yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine.
@danahull Jerome is driving Tesla Semi &amp; doing a great job with his team. At Daimler, he led their most successful semi truck program ever.
Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us. https://t.co/Kfg1ewKoCZ
@bolayer @SwiftOnSecurity US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
@Recode Article is misleading to readers. No one is "taking home" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
@BenjaminRPhoto @StephenPace Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious.
NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
